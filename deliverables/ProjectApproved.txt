===================================

This is a great idea!  Make sure that you ask the
user if the drive SHOULD be formatted before actually
doing the formatting.

Should be interesting to see how formatting gets
automatically linked to the kernel when you get this
completed.

You'll be using the "/dev" directory, right?

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
